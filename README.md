## Louis Claremont

I am a full stack developer and natural problem solver who loves finding beauty and order in complexity. My journey has included a Mathematics degree from the University of Bristol, scaling Bulgarian mountains and cycling the streets of Oxford. I have entered the world of tech as it will provide a continually stimulating and nourishing environment to develop and hone my skillset.

## Experience

**Makers Academy** (March 2023 to July 2023)  
Student software developer

- Responsible for our own working hours, for example I would begin at around 8:00am, take part in stand-up meetings at 9:30, pair program in the afternoon and finish coding at around 5pm.
- We focussed greatly on collaborative work, which has embedded excellent communication skills and a team mentality into my process. As in the above 'Acebook' project, we were having to negotiate different team members' levels of understandings of the codebase and therefore rotated pairs often and completed pull requests all together to ensure every team member had a chance to clarify anything about the code they may not have understood.
- Learning to test drive my code is a habit I have very much enjoyed as it allows me to confidently take on seemingly complex problems by breaking them down into easier managable steps. For example, the 'Bowling Scorecard' project above demonstrates some complex logic in the scorecard.js and frame.js files (to allow for strike / spare bonuses to be added) but my tests follow a very clear and logical progression in complexity.
- I've gained invaluable experience in agile methodologies during engineering projects (stand up meetings, spring planning, retros), allowing us to delegate tasks between the group and have used git branching and pull requests to combine our work.

**Oxwash** (November 2021 to October 2022)  
Cycle courier

- Collecting and delivering laundry from customers and businesses on an electric cargo bike, cycling around 30-40 miles a day.
- Having to work dynamically with the laundry team in order to get items ready and delivered on time. This team mentality and achieving group goals is something I have been able to take forward into software projects.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team

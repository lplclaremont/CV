## Louis Claremont

I am a full stack developer and natural problem solver who loves finding beauty and order in complexity. My journey has included a Mathematics degree from the University of Bristol, scaling Bulgarian mountains and cycling the streets of Oxford. I have entered the world of tech as it will provide a continually stimulating and nourishing environment to develop and hone my skillset.

## Experience

**Makers Academy** (March 2023 to July 2023)  
Student software developer

- Responsible for our own working hours, for example I would begin at around 8:00am, take part in stand-up meetings at 9:30, pair program in the afternoon and finish coding at around 5pm.
- We focussed greatly on collaborative work, which has embedded excellent communication skills and a team mentality into my process. As in the above 'Acebook' project, we were having to negotiate different team members' levels of understandings of the codebase and therefore rotated pairs often and completed pull requests all together to ensure every team member had a chance to clarify anything about the code they may not have understood.
- Learning to test drive my code is a habit I have very much enjoyed as it allows me to confidently take on seemingly complex problems by breaking them down into easier managable steps. For example, the 'Bowling Scorecard' project above demonstrates some complex logic in the scorecard.js and frame.js files (to allow for strike / spare bonuses to be added) but my tests follow a very clear and logical progression in complexity.
- I've gained invaluable experience in agile methodologies during engineering projects (stand up meetings, sprint planning, retros), allowing us to delegate tasks between the group and have used git branching and pull requests to combine our work.

**Oxwash** (November 2021 to October 2022)  
Cycle courier

- Collecting and delivering laundry from customers and businesses on an electric cargo bike, cycling around 30-40 miles a day.
- Having to work dynamically with the laundry team in order to get items ready and delivered on time. This team mentality and achieving group goals is something I have been able to take forward into software projects.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
During my time working in a ski chalet in Bulgaria, I honed my communication skills which were necessary to successfully work as part of a team to manage a busy workload. Clear and concise communication between my colleagues was vital to ensure stock was kept up to date, and we would have to cook food for other guests across all chalets, so this meant summarising the quantities and dietary requirements to colleagues.

During my time at Oxwash I'd often have to communicate between customers and our operations team. As a delivery cyclist, we would represent the company at people's homes and so providing a pleasant experience for them was key. I'd always answer questions they may have had about our process and if there was anything I did not know, I'd contact the team in the office and relay any information I could back to the customer. Training new staff members was also part of this role that I really enjoyed. I'd have new members of staff shadow me and therefore needed to convey the appropriate amount of information to make them comfortable and build up their confidence on the bicycles.
This necessity for concise and clear communication is also demonstrated in my work as a cook in ski chalets. We'd have to negotiate between chalets to organise the week's food order based on guest numbers and also would delegate tasks between our team at the start of each day in order to most efficiently get the work done.


#### Driven
I achieved the highest number of deliveries during two day period at my work for Oxwash and one day cycled over 60 miles in order to finish the day's tasks. We had an evening slot of 5-7pm and when our evening cyclist was off, I'd frequently extend my working day to cover for them. 

#### Independent problem solver

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
